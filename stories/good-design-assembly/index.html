    <p>For years, the world kept feeling bigger and bigger due to rapid globalization and expansion of technology. But when the pandemic struck, the world felt small again. Our corner of the world became as small as the corner of our bedrooms. Now, you’re closed off from the world inside the 4 walls of your home. Uncertainty still looming, the restrictions and lockdowns pushed us to open our windows, to see and continue the interaction from a safe distance.</p>

    <p>It was my first week in Works of Heart and what welcomed me was the team’s initiative, the Good Design Assembly. They wanted to create another space to learn from each other but it rippled into bigger waves wherein anyone and everyone can join and see how a group of designers conquer what good design is and how it becomes a big impact to everyone as Paulina Badion, project manager at Works of Heart and of the event itself, explained on how the event came about.</p>

    <p>The designers led conversations with topics that mattered to Works of Heart as well as to design studios and organizations next door. With different cultures, processes, and design styles, everyone in the audience was intrigued as to how they would be able to create, design, and measure social impact.</p>

<br/>

<br/>
<h4>Don’t let go of the opportunity for change</h4>

<p>One of the statements that resonated in the event was “patience and tenacity make change”, which Lei Motilla of AI4GOV—a social innovation for improving public services in the Philippines, explained in the first talk of the event entitled “Designing with citizens and government”. She talked with so much determination about the perseverance that one needs to enable work through and within the web of entailed problems in governance. With today’s generation, it seems more difficult day by day to strive for change, or the sense of hopelessness as most would feel, and to solve any problems within the government but Lei said “shake [government] gently to be able to transform”. Our public services will continue to work poorly if we give up so easily. Together with Oum Vipavee Kittitien of Satarana and Attention Studio, with a similar standpoint, she explained the urbanization in Thailand and how some of the disadvantages it brings can also be a hindrance to making a city operate rather than only making it look pretty. She also believes that both the government and citizens work hand in hand to make their city better; co-create cities for its people. There always seems to be that “hopelessness” lingering in the way. Even when I heard the title of the first talk, I was wondering how my own perception would change. Hearing designers talk about so much good work that can be done within the government pushes me back a step to see the bigger picture instead of aimlessly moving forward.</p>

<blockquote>"Patience and tenacity make change."</blockquote>
<p class="purple">— Lei Motilla, AI4GOV</p>

<p>Rhea Matute of the Design Center of the Philippines has the same sentiments as her co-speakers, especially as she is working in government. As an industrial designer, one of her goals is to help people see the change that we think isn’t there or is not in the process. “Transition changing people's mindset or definition of design beyond aesthetics” because most of us are fixated on the first impression of what a design would look like, sometimes we are stuck with just that—the first impression.</p>

<p>“You wish the evolution would go faster, so you usher the people’s journey through design and hope they would accept it. It’s a conversation between the people for it to be sustainable.” Rhea Matute says as one of the audience asked what she thinks about the frustrations of the change we are still in search of in government and how design can help in fostering these changes we want to see.</p>

<br/>

<h4>Starting small while managing bigger things</h4>
<p>We plan for so much to reach a certain goal that in the journey we feel there isn’t much progress which leads us to give up completely. In-Ah Shin from Feminist Designer Social Club or FDSC wanted to start with a smaller group first. She knew that she needed to start now and design for what she believes in and left a door open for more designers to be part of that space of starting. She was defiant for believing that her role as a designer and her role as a woman were not two separate things but one. Being a feminist myself, hearing about the club she has formed and what they do to keep issues like feminism and design up in the sky, gave me a refreshing new set of perspectives in our fast-paced world. And not only about feminism. Dang Sering, artist and writer, talked about how as a designer, she saw that going to one person after another helped her to understand each and every person more, especially in design for social impact. Being part of several artist residencies she also wanted to showcase individuals she met along her journey and be able to bring communities together. One of the exhibits she led, LOOK HERE, was bringing in women designers to share the spotlight, an opportunity that most designers can’t have. </p>


<p>In-Ah Shin and Dang Sering may be from different parts of the world but one thing I took away from their talk was that good change can be accomplished, even if you start little. In-Ah Shin said “If people have more needs, we need more people to help.”, championing change doesn’t immediately have to be big.</p>

<h4>Helping people to realize the dream, and convey the message</h4>
<p>When I wasn’t working at Works of Heart yet, I’ve personally learned about Miki-san of DOOR TO ASIA's collaborations and their designer’s art residency journey. What he talked about never changes and this is because it’s the foundation of what he is continuing to do and that is being able to connect people who have the same goal—come together and create impact for businesses who have the potential to do greater things. “Helping people to realize the dream, and convey the message” was Miki-san’s personal goal. When he talked about the partnership of local businesses in Japan and the Philippines, he showed how he mended possible opportunities between business owners and designers into stronger conversations, gradually creating impact for the work that both will and continue to do.</p>

<p>The story of a brand; its name, logo design, creative direction should always resonate with the people who did it and who it was designed for. Mag Wong, a graphic designer of Where’s Gut, showed a different translation of a brand and explained how it should guide the design team and the client to that goal they talked about in that first important meeting. To guide people with design, is how one should feel about creating social impact—with your desire to understand, create, and then translate into something you believe can tell the story. With how a brand tells its story, Nikki from AltMobility shares that being able to communicate the story visually and see that people react to it shows how it is already beginning to create social impact.</p>

<p>As we were distanced from each other with masks, face shields, or the very walls of our homes it was eye-opening, for designers and other professionals from a variety of backgrounds and industries continue to make designs that can and should impact— into waves or echoes that will reach people.</p>

<p>After the event, I saw how the conversation didn't stop from the zoom webinar room, but it extended to social media. Even when you’re at home, the conversation broke out from the screen; broke out from those 4 walls and reached other people. Even if you target a small group, if the messaging is right, the conversation continues on— across industries, across cultures, and across barriers.</p>
