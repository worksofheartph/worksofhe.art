<p>Every year, we ask our interns to work together on a design project for a social issue that they want to work on. This 2022, our interns decided to focus on agriculture.</p>

<p>Among these invited panelists, of whom we shared genuine and exciting conversations with were Raffy Magno from the Office of the Vice President, Pao Tiausas of TLDTD, Nikki Santos-Ocampo of AltMobility PH, Roxanne Fuentes from the public education division from CDO Misamis Oriental, Risa Barcelona of MAD Travel, and Clarisse Ligunas from the Philippine Department of Education. </p>

<p>Some topics of discussion included information on their sectors and challenges, case studies of their projects, as well as how they have been adjusting to the pandemic's "new normal". Each speaker had their own unique take on the questions, but one aspect of social entrepreneurship seemed to resonate across all sectors: <em>A radical need to collaborate</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://chiaski.com/">Chia Amisola</a>, <strong>3rd year Computing and the Arts, Yale University:	</strong> "We need to move away from the designer-savior complex where creatives feel like they can do a few weeks of research, be embedded in a problem with a snippet of numbers and metrics, and fix something. Design has the dangerous potential of being alienating and superficial. We need to recognize the need to give space for others who have long been immersed in problems, combat systemic inequalities that have never even been addressed by pure design, and turn pseudo-creativity into thoughtful, emancipatory acts."</p>

<p><a href="https://abiebungay.design/">Abie Bungay</a>, <strong>3rd year Bachelor of Fine Arts Major in Information Design, Minoring in Development Management at Ateneo De Manila University:</strong> "For most artists and designers, the initial and immediate instinct is to put something out to the world to showcase—whether it be a design intervention, a work of art, a piece of literary writing, etc. We rarely come to realize and reflect on the fact that design in itself has the ability to establish and/or modify spaces where our artists can be recognized and invited to collaborate. As much as we are able to put forward noteworthy work that occupy such avenues, we are also invited to build these spaces for collaboration in the first place—maybe this is even where we need to start."</p>

<p><a href="https://andiegamboa.carrd.co/">Andie Gamboa</a>, <strong>Bachelor of Arts Major in Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of St. La Salle</strong> "It isn't enough to immerse yourself into communities and different contexts. The bulk of the work happens after, in your ability to empathize and identify with the people you're designing for. It's easy to fall trap to individuation when it comes to creative work, but to recognize the importance of collectivity is an essential step into doing genuine work with purpose."</p>


<p><a href="https://macyescay.com/">Macy Escay</a>, <strong>4th year Bachelor of Fine Arts Major in Information Design at Ateneo de Manila University: </strong>  "Beyond deliverables and tangible collaterals, design is a continuous and collaborative service that you work on with others. It is a call to action to amplify the rise and movement of various social impact and advocacy-driven platforms for a better nation."</p>
