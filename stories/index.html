        <p>We’re serial passion project starters here at Works of Heart, if you can’t already tell. We’ve found that, as social impact designers, it’s our responsibility not only to help organizations do good, but to push what good design can do through studio-led initiatives—to do good ourselves.</p>

        <p>Our journey began when we packed our bags and journeyed to a far-away land called Quezon City. It was Bel’s first time in the North, in contrast to Ena having spent  years there. Although we weren’t quite sure of what to expect, we were both really excited. After riding through the usual Katipunan traffic and into Varsity Hills, we arrived at a bright orange house with a big banner up front that read in large, rainbow letters; “HAPIHOUSE: HOME OF HAPINOY.”</p>
