		</div>

		<div>
			<p>The role of historical education and awareness in the Philippines is increasing even more, especially given the current cultural milieu and its propensity for data manipulation, misinformation, and oversimplification.</p>

      <p>A commitment to national memory is of utmost priority—we need to be able to confront the complexities of today with a firm grasp of how the past has led us to our current situation.</p>

			<h5>Facing misinformation and misconceptions</h5>
			<p>The era of Martial Law, characterized most by the dictatorship's media censorship and human rights violations, is unquestionably an important time in Philippine history. Its value, however, lies in its political failure and the cautionary tale it holds: a mistake of this magnitude should never happen again to our country.</p>

			<p>Yet, when the initial brief for a “digital museum for everyone” was given to us, it became apparent that the sentiment and knowledge regarding Martial Law was not universal. Misinformation and misplaced nostalgia were commonplace. Lengthy threads in local social media would show a confusingly wide array of misconceptions and flat-out falsehoods. And, though one can technically fire back with accurate but possibly self-righteous statements, we felt that it would be a disservice to everyone involved.</p>

			<h5>Embracing education and engagement</h5>
			<p>Our continuous discussions with the project proponents eventually led us to reconsider the notion of a “digital museum for everyone.” The issue, unsurprisingly, was not at all about "displaying the facts" so that individuals can "correct" themselves. Rather, the issue was more complex: it was about access, the forms of engagement, school curriculums, and current educational strategies.</p>

			<p>We needed a slightly different way of answering our initial dilemma. Thus, the Martial Law Museum became a digital educational resource on the Martial Law in the Philippines. Teachers and researchers pooled together different historical resources, archival material, teaching modules, and community engagement programs. Its main thrust became education, not merely through information, but through engagement.</p>

		<div>
      <h5>Speaking to our audiences</h5>
			<p>Our strategy is to curate the website into one that could best reach its targeted groups in meaningful ways. We identified the three main audiences who would become the three most powerful agents: (1) the teachers, (2) the students or the general public, and (3) the advocates. The rationale was that by making available these credible and accessible resources, these groups would integrate it into their primary roles—whether through teaching or learning.</p>

      <p>Identifying the audience helped us create the website content strategy. We divided the website into three components, each targeting the specific audience group we identified. We used a call-to-action type of label for the components to fully capture the objective of the site: “Mag-aral” for students and the general public, “Magturo” for teachers, and “Manindigan” for advocates. </p>

      For the “Mag-aral” section or the Library, which comprises the main section of the whole website, we organized the information in a chronological manner, borrowing from how it should be taught traditionally in classrooms. This is in contrast to organizing it in themes, which has the disadvantage of appearing slanted or biased and thereby easily discredited by loyalists or those with hardened stances. The importance of values such as democracy, human rights, and freedom were constantly highlighted, so as to motivate these stakeholders in a way that is oriented to our commitment to a better future for our country.</p>

      The “Magturo” section or the Library is mostly for teachers and educators. Research tells us that Martial Law is a topic that Araling Panlipunan teachers struggle to teach because of its complexity and the lack of teaching resources about it. Teachers ask how to teach such a controversial topic best to their students. This section houses lesson plans, multimedia resources, and activities designed by historians, experts, and fellow teachers who've had experienced teaching Martial Law and have spent a lot of time designing such materials.</p>
