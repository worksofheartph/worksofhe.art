        <p>Young women form one of the most vulnerable sectors in our community as a consequence of gender inequality and the different ways it manifests. Aside from discrimination, they are placed in a position that forces them to deal with precarious living conditions, abuse, harassment, lack of access to basic care, and unjust labor practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these inequalities, especially for women and girls living below the poverty line.

          <h5 class="caption">World Vision Philippines, the largest non-profit in the country, rely on the generosity of donors to address the gaps left open by underpowered social services.<br><br>For the Internation day of the girl, they want to craft a campaign to sponsor 1000 girls. There are already a lot of fundraising campaigns, how do we resolve the problem of donor fatigue?</h5>
  </div>
		<div>
			  <h5>Starting early, starting young</h5>
        <p>Any attempt to address this inequality should therefore take into account those who are most vulnerable. Children are usually the focus of these efforts, given their limited agency or control over the factors that most immediately affect them.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.worldvision.org.ph/" target="_blank">World Vision Philippines</a>, the largest non-profit organization in the country, follows through on that principle by addressing the well-being of children through multi-sectoral approaches. Children can thrive if they are in environments where their physical, emotional, and mental health are all prioritized, as well as in environments where they have access to education and protection. If children are given this early chance to thrive, they have more opportunities to overcome systemic difficulties in the future.</p>

        <!--<p>Organizations such as World Vision Philippines address the gaps left open by underpowered social services. To have resources for these operations, they rely on the generosity of donors. World Vision Philippines, in pursuing its mission of caring for the well-being of children, uses a sponsorship model where donors can build a healthy relationship with their beneficiaries. This setup entails regular updates on the girl’s community and the exchange of letters between the two parties. In this way, the donation is not merely transactional; it is made personal.</p>-->

        <blockquote>If children are given this early chance to thrive, they have more opportunities to overcome systemic difficulties in the future.</blockquote>

        <h5>Building a campaign that resonates</h5>
        <p>World Vision Philippines’s communication team, <a href="https://www.thedissidentmovement.com/" target="_blank">Dissident</a>, reached out to us to help design the local edition of the Sponsor 1000 Girls campaign. The goal of the campaign was to have one thousand sponsorships in time for International Day of the Girl, October 11, 2020. Our role as Works of Heart was to carefully craft and visualize their message to reach that target number. Though we knew that this was a cause that many people empathized with, the campaign itself could still be difficult given donor fatigue in the country. Efforts for fund-raising and mutual aid have been constant since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to lackluster local crisis response.</p>

        <p>Given that context, our priority was to create a campaign that resonated with its target donors—middle- to upper-class individuals with enough disposable income to support these social justice efforts. We had to ask ourselves: What common experiences connect these working adults and the vulnerable young ladies identified by the program? How could we frame the call to action so that these connections between the two are highlighted and emphasized? How do we encourage these sponsorships on a deep, personal level?</p>

          <h5 class="caption">The campaign logo we designed features a stylized hashtag which resembles hands on top of each other or woven strands of thread—symbols of strength in numbers.

    <div>
      <h5>#GIRLSCAN HAVE A BETTER FUTURE</h5>
      <p>The capacity and ability of women have long been a battle cry for those advocating for gender equality. Restrictions have always been placed on what women are allowed to do and what they can achieve, from their childhood days in school to their adulthood in professional settings.</p>

      <p>From there, we honed in on the phrase “Girls Can”—it emphasizes the women as capable, and it also doubles as a liberating affirmation. Though commonly interpreted through the lens of individual talent and agency, we also wanted to tap its expression of possibility. We focused on the idea that for girls, especially those in the World Vision Philippines campaign, the potential is there and the possibilities are endless—as long as they receive the proper care and support.</p>

      <p>We can even take it one step further. When we talk about girls here, it points to the desired future made better by this campaign and other similar efforts that have come before it. By supporting and uplifting our most vulnerable sisters, we can shift the world towards one that will be better for all women. What is at stake here is slow and incremental change on the generational level. Donors are not just donors; they are also those who believe in creating a world that is fair to everyone. We are all connected to the same aspiration. After all, that is the burden and promise of something as grand as “#GirlsCan have a better future.”</p>

      <h5>PIECE BY PIECE, JOURNEY BY JOURNEY</h5>
      <p>Women have shared experiences that only women can fully understand. However, there is still a big gap between women who have easy access to opportunities and women who need support. Though there may be different journeys, all of these play a part in how women will move forward to a better future.</p>

      <p>Our primary visual material for the campaign then consisted of scenic illustrations resembling patchwork and bold colors that evoke a sense of pride and strength. These illustrations showcased the human element behind the campaign. This focus makes sure that the girls here are not reduced to statistics nor abstract concepts. The colors, on the other hand, mirrored the vitality of these lives.</p>

      <p>The patchwork motif of the hashtag repeats the idea of interconnectedness, especially when fully connected with the key phrase: #GirlsCan. We wanted to put forward the idea that this better world for all women is possible, but it is not a burden to be shouldered by any individual or specific group. Only through consistent effort—piece by piece, journey by journey—can we connect ourselves to this larger story of women empowerment.</p>

      <p>During the campaign period, World Vision PH eventually reached its local target of 224 sponsorships and even surpassed it by ending at a total of 318.</p>

      <h5>Opening better paths and possibilities</h5>
      <p>Collective effort is the solid foundation of all advocacies. With most social issues being multifaceted, as is the case with gender inequality, banking on that connection between those who share the same goal is one way to keep picking away at these problems.</p>

      <p>One has to remember that this is not an individual story: this is a narrative where success for all is what ultimately matters in the end. Though one’s part may come in the form of a single sponsorship or in the form of a warmly written letter of gratitude to someone who has chosen to help out, these are all important in our wish to keep opening the doors toward better worlds for women.</p>
